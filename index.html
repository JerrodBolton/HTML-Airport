        <h2> Why Jason Hate The Airport </h2>

        <p>
            Jason hated the airport. Not in the way most people disliked the long security lines or overpriced
            coffee—his
            hatred was deep, personal, and unshakable. Every time he stepped foot inside, his chest tightened, his
            patience
            evaporated, and the walls seemed to close in on him. </p>

        <p>
            It all started years ago, on what should have been a simple trip home for Christmas. His flight was
            scheduled
            for 6 PM. He arrived two hours early, just like they always told him to. But a sudden storm turned the
            departures board into a chaotic mess of delayed and canceled flights. One by one, his options dwindled until
            he
            found himself stuck in the terminal overnight. The floor was too hard to sleep on, the announcements were
            too
            loud to tune out, and the one power outlet he could find had already been claimed by a family charging seven
            different devices.
        </p>


        <p> That night, he made the mistake of buying a $14 sandwich that tasted like sadness and disappointment. Worse,
            he
            was trapped near a man who wouldn’t stop loudly FaceTiming his girlfriend, detailing every boring aspect of
            his
            delay in real time. <i>“Yeah, babe, I know, it’s crazy. Yeah, the plane is still not here. Yeah, I’m just
                sitting
                here. Yeah, the guy next to me looks mad.” </i></p>

        <p> Jason was mad.</p>


        <p> And that was just the beginning. Over the years, the airport found new ways to torment him. The TSA agent
            who
            made him take off his belt, then loudly announced that his pants were falling down. The baby that screamed
            non-stop for four hours at Gate B12. The guy who took his shoes off on a packed flight and propped his bare
            feet
            right next to Jason’s armrest.</p>

        <p> But the final straw—the moment that sealed his undying hatred—was the baggage claim incident. After a
            grueling
            12-hour travel day, he waited. And waited. And waited some more. The carousel spun, bags emerged, people
            left,
            and still… no suitcase. Finally, an airline worker shuffled over and muttered the words he dreaded: <i>
                “Looks
                like
                your bag didn’t make it.” </i></p>

        <p>Gone.</p>
        <p> From that moment on, Jason swore off flying whenever possible. He took road trips. He endured 18-hour train
            rides. He even once considered taking a bus across the country. Anything to avoid the cold, fluorescent-lit
            hell
            that was the airport.</p>

        <p> Because the airport didn’t care about him. The airport swallowed people whole, chewed them up, and spit them
            out
            exhausted, frustrated, and missing at least one essential item.</p>

        <p> And Jason? He would never forgive it.</p>

        <h2> Why Jason Love Airport </h2>

        <p>
            Most people saw the airport as a necessary evil—a place of long lines, overpriced coffee, and endless
            waiting.
            But not Jason. Jason loved the airport.
        </p>

        <p>
            To him, the airport wasn’t just a place; it was an adventure waiting to happen. The moment he stepped
            inside, he
            felt a rush of excitement. The smell of fresh-baked pretzels from the food court, the hum of rolling
            suitcases,
            the flashing departure boards promising journeys to places he had never been—every detail filled him with
            joy.
        </p>

        <p>
            He arrived early. Always. Not because he had to, but because he wanted to. While others groaned at the idea
            of a
            three-hour wait, Jason relished every moment. He would stroll through the terminals, people-watching and
            imagining their stories. Was that businessman heading to a big meeting? Was the young couple off to their
            honeymoon? He once saw an old man tear up as he hugged his daughter goodbye, and Jason felt honored to
            witness
            such a raw, beautiful moment of human connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Security was never a hassle for him. In fact, he found it oddly satisfying—the efficiency of removing his
            shoes,
            the rhythm of placing his laptop in a bin, the beep of the scanner confirming all was clear. It was a
            system, a
            dance, and Jason had perfected it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once past security, he treated the terminal like his personal paradise. A quick stop at his favorite café
            for a
            cinnamon latte, a leisurely browse through the bookstore where he always bought something (because what’s a
            trip
            without a new book?), and then, his favorite part—watching the planes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jason could sit by the giant windows for hours, watching aircraft glide down the runway, taking off into the
            sky. Each one was a promise, a possibility. It fascinated him how something so massive could lift into the
            air
            so effortlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Delays? No problem. Extra time just meant another chance to explore. Maybe he’d check out a new restaurant
            or
            strike up a conversation with a fellow traveler. Some of his best memories were made in airports—a
            spontaneous
            lunch with a backpacker who had been to 30 countries, a deep conversation with an elderly woman who told him
            stories of her youth, even a chance encounter that led to a lifelong friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Jason, the airport wasn’t just a stop along the way. It was a place where anything could happen. A
            gateway
            to adventure. A reminder that the world was big, full of stories, and waiting to be explored. </p>
        <p>
            And every time he boarded a plane, he already looked forward to the next time he’d be back.
        </p>
